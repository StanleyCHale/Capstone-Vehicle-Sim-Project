# Driver's Altitude

**A free, open-source, and realistic car simulation.**

This program allows the user to control up to two cars and drive them around on randomly generated terrain using their keyboard and mouse, or a console controller! There are already many wonderful vehicle-driving programs out in the world already, but for someone with an interest in vehicles that doesn't want to commit to having to spend money, this program can be a great alternative.​

This program is great for allowing the user to see how a car handles bumpy terrain, going uphill, downhill, or on flat ground in the various valleys and peaks found in the simulated world.​

With many adjustable parameters prebuilt into the program and an open-source codebase, this project allows easy modding support for developers, and fully customizable mechanics for advanced users.
