<h3>A free, open-source, and realistic car simulation.</h3>

This program allows the user to control up to two cars and drive them around on randomly generated terrain using their keyboard and mouse, or a console controller! There are already many wonderful vehicle-driving programs out in the world already, but for someone with an interest in vehicles that doesn't want to commit to having to spend money, this program can be a great alternative.​

This program is great for allowing the user to see how a car handles bumpy terrain, going uphill, downhill, or on flat ground in the various valleys and peaks found in the simulated world.​

With many adjustable parameters prebuilt into the program and an open-source codebase, this project allows easy modding support for developers, and fully customizable mechanics for advanced users.

The Bevy game engine performs really well because of its ability to automatically parallelize and cache where it can. It has the fastest ECS (entity component system) according to some benchmarks.
