├── docs/
├── src/
├── wip/

The docs/ directory contains our supporting team documents for our team deliverables and assignments.

The src/ directory contains our codebase for the project.

The wip/ directory is our Work in Progress directory. It contains assignment templates that we will modify/update during the year (e.g., diagrams, design files, documents, reviews, progress reports, etc.)

**The LICENSE is currently CC0 and will need to be changed by the end of the year!


A Few Things to Address
Once you've cloned, forked, or simply copied the content of this repository to your own:

Invite your co-contributors/co-developers to make changes to the repository
Change the license (currently CC0), discuss that with your project partner or sponsor
Initialize the repository for your programming language (your code should probably end up in src/), including updating the .gitignore
Learn to build the docs/ (see below) or opt for another documentation solution
Check out the course templates in wip/
Create your first issues and organise them in a project/kanban board
Building the Docs
Your docs template is Starlight. It's a template for Astro.
